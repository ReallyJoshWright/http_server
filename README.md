# HTTP Server

This is an implementation of an http server from scratch in C++.
This is a learning experience that may result in a full fledged http server
for C++.

## Current system assumptions
- You are on linux
- You have ***make*** installed
- You have g++ as a compiler capable of running c++23


## Getting started
- ***make run***

## Todo
- add windows functionality
- add web socket implementation for hot reloading
- add route handling
- add better error handling
- add examples
